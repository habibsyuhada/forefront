      <p><strong>Part 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions relating to Assessments and Site Visit</strong></p>
      <p>This Part is relevant for all Services that may include assessments and site visits.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>&nbsp;Qualification and Selection of Assessors / Our personnel<br>
      </strong>Impartiality and Conflicts of Interests is paramount in our operations. Forefront ensure all internal and external personnel are aware of impartiality. Our operations capture Conflicts of Interest/impartiality incorporating potential and perceived on our document reference FF15. Communication of such matters is maintained.Forefront ensures that all assessments will be performed by appropriately qualified, trained and impartial assessors. Forefront will select the appropriate assessors to perform the assessments. Forefront may change the assessor at any time. In the event of a change in assessor by Forefront, no additional fees will be charged to you.You may request Forefront to change the assessor with at least 30 days written notice prior to the commencement of an assessment, provided that you agree to pay any additional fees or expenses incurred by Forefront in providing an alternative assessor.</li>
      <li><strong>&nbsp;Arrangement of Assessment Visits to your Sites<br>
      </strong>Forefront will arrange visits to your site or sites as described on the Proposal, or, if later, as may be agreed with you in writing. Unless Forefront determines that an unannounced visit is necessary, Forefront will inform you of the assessment visits within a reasonable time in advance of the visits.If the timetable for visits is determined by the relevant standard within our scope of certification, you and Forefront each agree to comply with that timetable. If the frequency of visits is not fixed by the relevant standards Forefront will arrange them at its reasonable discretion.In each case, you will provide Forefront and its assessor all reasonable access to all and any areas of the site, data and records, and any materials and equipment as the assessor deems reasonably necessary in order to allow the assessor to undertake the assessment.Either party may change the date of a visit. In order to do this:a) <u class="text-dark">if you change the date of the visit</u>: you must do so by giving not fewer than 30 days advance written notice to Forefront. If you fail to give the required written notice, you will be liable to pay the full fee for the originally booked visit. You may not delay the date of a visit if to do so would have the effect of invalidating your certification.<br>
      b) <u class="text-dark">if Forefront changes the date of the visit</u>: Forefront may do this at any time up to 24 hours prior to the booked date of the visit, and Forefront will contact you to agree a revised date. This will be notified on our document FF26.In certain circumstances (such as non-compliance with the relevant standard) it may be necessary for Forefront to make additional visits. You will be liable for the fee for any additional visits at Forefront’s standard assessment day rate applicable at the time of the additional visit. This is normally associated where a major non-conformity is identified.You as the client have the responsibility for consistently achieving the intended results of implementation of the management system standard and conformity with the requirements for certification.</li>
      <li><strong>Observed Visits<br>
      </strong>Forefront’s assessor may be accompanied by a third-party observer from time to time, who is to witness an assessment. Forefront will inform you, as well as provide you with the identity of the observer, within a reasonable time prior to the visit. A third-party observer will only accompany the Forefront assessor if the third-party observer is subject to confidentiality obligations at least to the same level as those to which Forefront is bound. The fee for the visit will not be increased due to the visit being observed. This is applicable to our Notification Notice Form FF12.</li>
      <li><strong>Assessors’ Health and Safety<br>
      </strong>When an assessor attends your premises, you are responsible for ensuring that adequate information is given on the hazards and risks to which the assessor may be exposed.Please provide the assessor with an appropriate level of supervision as well as all necessary personal protective equipment. You will immediately notify Forefront of any event, accident or incident on your premises which could pose a risk to an assessor.If, while on your premises, the assessor has reason to believe that you are not complying with the relevant health and safety rules, or that the assessor’s safety is at risk in any way, then the assessor may abort the visit. Forefront will report to you the reasons for the termination of the visit. In such an event, Forefront will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. Forefront will not attend the affected premises again until it is satisfied that the issues so reported have been resolved.</li>
      <li><strong>Assessors’ Entry Requirements<br>
      </strong>You must, at the time of arranging a visit, notify Forefront of the health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements applicable to visitors to the premises. Forefront will observe all such health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements that you notify to Forefront, and notify to the assessor on arrival at the site. If, by observing these rules and other requirements, Forefront is prevented from providing the Services, Forefront will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. If the Proposal requires a visit to a third party’s premises, you assure that you have a relationship with the third party that permits Forefront to attend the premises of the third party for the purposes of the Contract.</li>
      <li><strong>&nbsp;Damages for failure to meet the number of audit days requested<br>
      </strong>If you cancel agreed and booked audit dates or end this Contract prior to our being able to provide you with any of the Services, you fail to meet the number of audit days requested by you (and stated in the Proposal) in any one year, for any reason other than a Force Majeure.</li>
      <li><strong>&nbsp;Term of Proposal<br>
      </strong>If an initial assessment is not conducted within one year of the date of the Proposal due to any reason other than the fault of Forefront, this Contract shall terminate insofar as it relates to Assessment and Site visits, and you will need to reapply for such services, which may be at other rates to the ones quoted to you in the Proposal.</li>
