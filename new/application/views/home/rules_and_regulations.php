      <p>ForeFront provides certification services to International management systems standards such as the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001</p></li>
      <li data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><b class="text-dark">SCOPE OF THE RULES OF REGISTRATION
      </b></b><p><b><b></b></b>A company (or partnership, government department, local authority or other appropriate body), whose management system for part or all its operation (its scope) has been assessed by ForeFront as being compliant with the requirements of the relevant standard, may be granted registration.</p>
      <p>ForeFront maintains and makes publicly accessible on request, a directory of valid certifications.The continuance of registration for such scope is dependent upon the outcome of periodic surveillance/re-certification audits of the company’s system by ForeFront to assure itself that all the requirements of the current edition of the relevant standard continue to be met by the company</p></li>
      <li data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><b class="text-dark">IMPARTIALITY AND  CONFIDENTIALITY</b></b>
      <p>Honesty and integrity with impartiality are the cornerstones upon which ForeFront certification was founded and upon which we operate. We are proud that ForeFront has always maintained a high standard of behaviour. We intend that ForeFront conducts its affairs according to the highest standards of performance and its business actions of all ForeFront Certification comply with spirit and intent of the law and moral codes under which we operate. Form and appearance is important. We expect all employees to behave in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of both corporate and personal behaviour.</p>
      <p>Our overriding principle is integrity and we pledge ourselves to be honest in our relationship with each other, with individuals outside the company and with other organizations. There is no way to ensure proper behaviour except through the desire of the individual. There is no way to provide rules of conduct that will apply to every situation. The Ethical Policy Statement establishes a broad role of conduct which sets minimum goals and guidelines to cover the most common and the most sensitive situations.The use of funds, property, or things of value of the company or of subsidiaries for any purpose which would be violation of any applicable law or regulations is strictly prohibited.</p></li>
      <li data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><b class="text-dark">APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION
      </b></b><p><b><b></b></b>The process of registration normally involves a Stage 1 audit of the company’s management system and a subsequent Stage 2 audit of the implementation of that system.The Company will apply to ForeFront with a proposed scope of registration including all addresses where the activities within scope are carried out.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the company to ensure the scope covers their requirements.</p>
