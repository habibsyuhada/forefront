      <h4><strong>5S for business improvement</strong></h4>
      <p>One of the methods of determining an organisations approach to its business is to evaluate its workplace organisation capability &amp; visual management standards.<strong> &nbsp;5S engages people through the use of ‘Standards’ and ‘Discipline’.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The 5 Steps are as follows</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort out & separate that which is needed & not needed in the area.</li>
        <li><strong>Straighten:</strong> Arrange items that are needed so that they are ready & easy to use. Clearly identify locations for all items so that anyone can find them & return them once the task is completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shine:</strong> Clean the workplace & equipment on a regular basis in order to maintain standards & identify defects.</li>
        <li><strong>Standardise:</strong> Revisit the first three of the 5S on a frequent basis and confirm the condition of the Gemba using standard procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Keep to the rules to maintain the standard & continue to improve every day.</li>
      </ul>
