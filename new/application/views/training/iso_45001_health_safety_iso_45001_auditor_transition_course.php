              <p>Note: This course makes references to ISO 45001 for the basis of the audit, but it does not address ISO 45001 in detail and does not equip delegates with the knowledge and skills to determine conformity, or otherwise, with ISO 45001. Delegates requiring the knowledge and skills to conduct entire OH&S management system audits against ISO 45001 should attend the ISO 45001 Lead Auditor Course.</p>
              <p>This course is based on IRCA specification PT249 Internal Auditor.</p>
