              <p>The key objectives are to enhance the participantsâ€™ existing knowledge and skills to enable them to become more effective at managing their work process, and meeting customer requirements. The aim is that by the end of the course, a participant will understand:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The role of FMEA in new product / service introduction, process management and improvement</li>
                <li>How to develop and interpret a PFMEA</li>
                <li>How process problems and product failures can be avoided</li>
                <li>How other tools and techniques complement FMEA</li>
                <li>The control plan methodology</li>
                <li>The link with quality management requirements, e.g. ISO/TS 16949, APQP / PPAP</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
