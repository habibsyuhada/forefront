      <h4>Integrated Management Systems</h4>
      <p>There are various mutual fundamentals between ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 27001. E.g. Document control, management review, document control, corrective action and the requirement for competent personnel. According to Annex SL, a new high-level structure, you can combine these standards into a single joint system.</p>

                <p align="left">  ISO 9001 is the <strong>most well-known standard</strong> ever  and is implemented by more than a million<strong> organisations</strong> in some <strong>175  countries</strong>.</p>
                <p align="left">  ISO 9001 is a <strong>generic</strong>standard. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>It </strong>means that the same  standards can be applied: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to <strong>any organisation</strong>, large or small, whatever its product or  service. </li>
                  <li>It can be any sector of business, whether it is a business enterprise, a  public administration, or a government department. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>ISO  9001:2015 is the internationally recognised quality management system for  structuring an organisation to improve business efficiency and increase  customer satisfaction.</strong>
                </p><p>  ISO 9001 gives  your customers the assurance that systems are continually assessed and  approved. The certification of ISO 9001 will contribute to increased revenue  and market share.
                </p><p>  ISO standards  generate an excellent contribution to the quality world. ISO standards enhance  investment, propagate knowledge, support innovative developments in technology,  and develop management and conformity assessment practices.
                </p><p>  This International  Standard ISO 9001 is based on <strong>seven</strong> Quality Management Principles. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3><strong>The Quality Management Principles are:</strong></h3>
                <h3><strong>Customer Focus</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Good  Customer Service Is Vital</strong>
                </p><p>  Generally, every  person who makes a complaint would share their displeasure with around 20  others, or so the saying goes.
                </p><p>  Technology and  smartphones allow virtually instant news and updates at our fingertips. For  example, suggestions for dining out or entertainment, and the likes of  TripAdvisor where users can post their opinion, reviews or complaints, and  others can read it.
                </p><p>  So, depending on  the complainant, displeasure may meet the attention of more than 20 — many,  many more.
                </p><p>  Imagine a  celebrity blogger with millions of followers, who experienced disappointment  with your product or service, then wrote a negative article or produced a vlog  (video blog) about their experience with your product. Possibly, irreversible  damage in an instant.
                </p><p>  One prime example  was United Airways. Their baggage handlers broke a guitar belonging to a  celebrity singer. After his efforts failed to gain any remuneration or even  flight vouchers to the value of the repairs, he wrote a song about his  experience. This song led to millions of views, and people were boycotting  United Airlines.
                </p><p>  It is therefore  critical that we manage complaints quickly and professionally when we work in  any industry, especially in quality-driven manufacturing sectors.

                </p><h4><strong>How does ISO  Certification help?</strong></h4>
                <p>  ISO standards  communicate to us that a company is benefiting from extra engagement and  support with their customers by understanding their customers’ needs and  expectations. Engaging with the customer is one of the core principles of the  ISO 9001 Quality Management System.</p>
                <p> ISO9001:2015 is the internationally  recognised quality management system for structuring an organisation to improve  business efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. Therefore, gaining an  ISO accreditation gives your customers assurance that your procedures and  processes are continually assessed and approved, and your business operates  with customer service as a fundamental principle.&nbsp; </p>
                <h4><strong>Leadership</strong></h4>
                <p>  Leadership is an important skill to motivate a group of individuals  towards a common goal. Stable leadership is vital for the success of  businesses. World’s most respected leaders have common qualities. Quality of  shared vision is the most recognisable trait of all of them. Also,&nbsp; initiate change, inspire a shared vision and  encourage the team’s behaviours that are necessary to achieve the shared ideas.  Good leaders are confident to empower others to commit and thrive. </p>
                <p>  A  person or group of individuals, who lead the organisation&nbsp;at the highest  level towards the common goal is called “Top management”. </p>
                <h4><strong>The Quality Policy</strong> </h4>
                <p>  Top management shall  create, implement and maintain a quality policy:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>appropriate to the context of the organisation and supports  its strategic direction;</li>
                  <li>provides a framework for setting quality objectives;</li>
                  <li>includes a commitment to satisfy applicable requirements;</li>
                  <li>Consists of assurance  to continual improvement of the system<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>  The  quality policy shall:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>be accessible and be maintained as documented information;</li>
                  <li>be communicated, applied and understood within the  organisation;</li>
                  <li>be available to relevant appropriate interested parties, as  necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Roles and  Responsibilities</strong></h4>
                <p>  Top management shall allocate the  responsibility and authority to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure that the processes are delivering their planned outputs; </li>
                  <li>Determine opportunities for Improvement; </li>
                  <li>Communicate the importance of customer focus  to everyone; </li>
                  <li>When  planning ad implementing changes to  the quality management system ensure that the integrity of the quality management  system is maintained<strong> </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Top management shall  evaluate the organisation’s quality management system, at strategic intervals,  to ensure its continuing suitability, capability, effectiveness and alignment  with the strategic direction of the organisation.</strong></p>
                <h4> <strong>Engagement of People</strong></h4>
                <p>  Engaging people  means&nbsp;teams are committed and motivated towards the organisation’s goals  and values. An engaged team experiences job satisfaction and feelings of  empowerment and will contribute more towards growth.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Engaging people  means&nbsp;employees are satisfied and dedicated to their organisation’s goals,  missions and strategy. Happy employees play a significant role in your  organisation, as ambassadors of the company.</li>
                  <li>Engaged employees are often top  performers, their absenteeism lowers, leading to increased productivity and  would ‘go the extra mile’ to accomplish business success. </li>
                  <li>Engaged and satisfied employees  will become more loyal. Therefore, more likely to stay with the organisation  for longer resulting in less turnover of staff.</li>
                  <li>Engaged employees bring passion to  their job, which leads to innovation in the workplace and efficiently makes a  great effort to create new products, services and processes.</li>
                  <li>Engaged employees become more  productive and efficient, positively affecting the organisations’ bottom line.  Therefore, incline to have higher profits by lowering operating costs and  increasing the profit margin. </li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h4><strong>Process Approach</strong></h4>
                <p>Processes are dynamic-they cause  things to happen. A structured process helps to accomplish any objective  efficiently and effectively. It helps to define the required steps essential to  obtain desired outcomes. It helps to establish clear responsibility and  accountability for managing key activities. It helps to monitor, measure and  evaluate risks of the process.&nbsp; It helps  to focus effort on critical processes and opportunities for improvement.</p>
                <p><strong>All processes and the Quality Management  System (ISO 9001:2015) can apply Plan, do, check, Act (PDCA).</strong> <br>
                    <br clear="ALL">
                  Briefly,&nbsp; the description of PDCA is as follows:</p>
                <p><strong><u>Plan:</u></strong>&nbsp; Plan the  objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources required to  deliver results by tracking customers’ requirements and the organisation’s  policies;<br>
                  <strong><u>Do:</u></strong>&nbsp;  Implement the&nbsp; plan; <br>
                  <strong><u>Check:</u></strong>&nbsp;  Monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting  products and services against policies, objectives and requirements and analyse  the outcomes;<br>
                  <strong><u>Act:</u></strong> Take actions to improve performance, as  required.</p>
                <h4><strong>Improvement</strong></h4>
                <p>  The organisation  should have a consistent approach to development on the road to growth. The  organisation should provide team training to improve their abilities and should  work towards the development of products, processes, and systems. </p>
                <h4> <strong>Evidence-based Decision-making</strong> <strong> </strong></h4>
                <p><strong><em>“Decisions  based on the analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to  produce desired results.”</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Evidence is information that shows or proves  that something is true or false. Evidence should consist of observations,  measurements and tests. Decision making should be evidence-based. The  organisation should ensure that information is sufficiently accurate and  reliable and accessible to those who need them. The organisation should use  appropriate tools to make decisions based on evidence of data, together with  experience.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4><strong>Relationship Management</strong></h4>
                <p><strong><em>“For sustained  success, organisations manage their relationships with interested parties, such  as suppliers. “An&nbsp;interested party&nbsp;is a person or group that has a  stake in the&nbsp;success or performance of an organisation</em></strong>.&nbsp;<br>
                  Interested parties&nbsp;can be from inside  or&nbsp;outside of the organisation. <strong>Examples of&nbsp;interested  parties&nbsp;include&nbsp;customers, suppliers, partners, owners, employees,  unions,&nbsp;bankers, or members of the community.&nbsp;Interested parties&nbsp;are  also known as&nbsp;stakeholders.</strong> Managing relations with interested parties  means sharing&nbsp;knowledge, vision and values. The organisation establishes a  relationship that balance short-term gains with long term considerations. <strong>The organisations need to determine the needs and  expectations of interested parties.</strong></p>
                <h4><strong>Understanding the Organisation and its Context</strong> </h4>
                <p>The organisation shall determine internal and  external issues appropriate to its planned path and what can affect to  accomplish the intended result(s). The organisation shall monitor and review  information about these external and internal issues. Issues can be positive or  negative factors. </p>
                <p>  External  issues that exist outside of the organisation that can affect the  organisation’s ability to achieve sustained success. e.g. statutory and  regulatory requirements, competition, social, economic, political and cultural  factors etc.</p>
                <p>  Internal  issues that exist within the organisation itself that can affect the  organisation’s ability to achieve sustained success. e.g. size and complexity,  strategy, type of products and services, resources etc.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Internal Audits</strong></p>
                <p>  An <strong>audit</strong> is a systematic  examination of statutory records and documents to ascertain how far the  system/process present an accurate and fair view of the concern. <br>
                  The organisation shall  conduct <a name="_Hlk19229104">internal audits </a>at strategic intervals to  provide evidence that the Quality Management System is efficiently implemented  and maintained and conforms to the organisation’s requirements for its quality  management system. The organisation should take necessary corrective actions  without unjustifiable delay and retain documented information as proof of the  completing of the audit programme and the audit results.</p>
                <h4><strong>Nonconformity and Corrective action</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Nonconformity</strong> </p>
                <p>  Nonconformity  in the management system (occasionally referred to as a fault/failure) is a  deviation from an ISO standard, a requirement<a name="_GoBack"></a>, or a  result. In other words, any failure to meet a condition/requirement is called  nonconformity — i.e. Failure to follow a&nbsp;procedure. </p>
                <p>There two types of nonconformities. <strong>Major Nonconformance and Minor  Nonconformance</strong> </p>
                <p>A <strong>Major Nonconformance also referred to as  NC</strong> is an absence of a procedure in your Quality Management System, therefore  not the ISO 9001 requirements. For example: not implementing a part of the  standard or a process. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>A <strong>Minor Nonconformance</strong> is an occurrence  which does not meet the ISO 9001 requirements but does not have any significant  consequences. i.e. a single incident of not having proper paperwork for  inspecting equipment.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Integrated Management  Systems&nbsp;will have a constructive impact on the outcomes of the ISO  Management Systems.</li>

              <strong>Annex  SL a new high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards in  future.</strong><br><br>
                Annex SL is not an ISO standard. However,  it is a guide to help &nbsp;ISO consultants and organisations to implement  multiple/integrated (MMS/IMS) Management Systems Standards. Over the years, ISO  has published several management system standards for areas of quality,  environment, information security, health and safety and many more.&nbsp; ISO management system&nbsp;standards share  common fundamentals. However, they are not sufficiently aligned, so they were  difficult to integrate at the implementation phase. The most significant  disadvantage was the duplication of work. The guideline of Annex SL will help  you to create a system that entails less maintenance and resources, e.g.  producing one document or process instead of many.<br><br>
                <em>“It is the publication of Annex SL  (formerly ISO Guide 83) which outlines the framework for a generic management  system. All new ISO Management System Standards (MSS) will follow to this  framework, and all current MSS will migrate to the structure at their  succeeding revision. </em><br><br>
                <strong><em>In future, all ISO Management System  Standards (MSS) should be consistent and compatible - they will all have the  same look and feel</em></strong><em>. Annex SL guidelines  could be the commencement of the end of the conflicts, duplication, confusion  and misunderstanding arising from slightly different requirements across the  various ISO Management System Standards.”</em><br><br>
                <strong><em>Reference  IRCA briefing note Annex SL</em></strong><br><br>
                Annex SL (a high-level structure ) is  created to incorporate more than one ISO standard. Several organisations seek  to implement and certify multiple management system standards such as ISO 9001,  ISO 14001, ISO 27001 and ISO 45001. Implementation of more than one standard  has led to the necessity to combine or integrate them effectively and  efficiently. Annex SL (a high-level structure ) helps the organisations to  incorporate these standards. Annex SL defines the outline for a conventional  ISO Management System. <br><br>
                <strong>The Annex SL structure and commonly  used terms and definitions will make it easier to comply with and maintain the  ISO standards requirements with less time and at a lower cost.</strong><br>
                <strong>The most popular standards using Annex  SL are: </strong></p>
