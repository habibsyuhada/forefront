              <strong>Annex  SL a new high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards in  future.</strong><br><br>
                Annex SL is not an ISO standard. However,  it is a guide to help &nbsp;ISO consultants and organisations to implement  multiple/integrated (MMS/IMS) Management Systems Standards. Over the years, ISO  has published several management system standards for areas of quality,  environment, information security, health and safety and many more.&nbsp; ISO management system&nbsp;standards share  common fundamentals. However, they are not sufficiently aligned, so they were  difficult to integrate at the implementation phase. The most significant  disadvantage was the duplication of work. The guideline of Annex SL will help  you to create a system that entails less maintenance and resources, e.g.  producing one document or process instead of many.<br><br>
                <em>“It is the publication of Annex SL  (formerly ISO Guide 83) which outlines the framework for a generic management  system. All new ISO Management System Standards (MSS) will follow to this  framework, and all current MSS will migrate to the structure at their  succeeding revision. </em><br><br>
                <strong><em>In future, all ISO Management System  Standards (MSS) should be consistent and compatible - they will all have the  same look and feel</em></strong><em>. Annex SL guidelines  could be the commencement of the end of the conflicts, duplication, confusion  and misunderstanding arising from slightly different requirements across the  various ISO Management System Standards.”</em><br><br>
                <strong><em>Reference  IRCA briefing note Annex SL</em></strong><br><br>
                Annex SL (a high-level structure ) is  created to incorporate more than one ISO standard. Several organisations seek  to implement and certify multiple management system standards such as ISO 9001,  ISO 14001, ISO 27001 and ISO 45001. Implementation of more than one standard  has led to the necessity to combine or integrate them effectively and  efficiently. Annex SL (a high-level structure ) helps the organisations to  incorporate these standards. Annex SL defines the outline for a conventional  ISO Management System. <br><br>
                <strong>The Annex SL structure and commonly  used terms and definitions will make it easier to comply with and maintain the  ISO standards requirements with less time and at a lower cost.</strong><br>
                <strong>The most popular standards using Annex  SL are: </strong></p>
