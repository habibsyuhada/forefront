      <h3><strong>ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS)</strong></h3>
      <p>The ISO&nbsp;14000 family of standards provides practical tools for organisations of all categories, allowing them to manage their environmental responsibilities.</p>
      <p>ISO 14001 requires that a business should consider all environmental aspects critical to its operations. For example, Waste Management, Soil Contamination, Air Pollution, Water and Sewage issues, Climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

      <h4>Integrated Management Systems</h4>
      <p>There are various mutual fundamentals between ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 27001. E.g. Document control, management review, document control, corrective action and the requirement for competent personnel. According to Annex SL, a new high-level structure, you can combine these standards into a single joint system.</p>

              <p align="left">&nbsp;ISO  14001 same as other ISO Standards should have systems and strategies for  continual improvement towards environmental concerns. The standard has recently  been revised, with crucial enhancements such as the prominent significance of  environmental management within the organisation’s tactical planning processes,  increased contribution from leadership and a more robust responsibility to  positive initiatives that increase environmental efficiency.</p>

              </ul>
              <h4><strong>Context  of the Organisation</strong><br>
              <br>
              <strong>There is a requirement to find out an organisation’s  direct environmental impacts. How environmental surroundings can affect your  business, customers and supply chain. </strong></h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The organisation should determine issues  that are appropriate to its purpose and&nbsp;affects its ability to accomplish  the intended outcomes of its environmental management system. </li>
                <li>Internal issues might be noise pollution,  air quality, or waste haulage and its costs. External issues might comprise  customers and legal requirements. </li>
                <li>Interested parties or stakeholders could  be an individual or an organisation that can affect, be affected by, or perceive  itself to be affected by an organisation’s decisions or activities. The  organisation’s adjoining neighbours, various governmental environmental  agencies could be interested parties as well as customers.</li>
                <li>Other interested parties may include communities,  suppliers, regulators, NGOs, investors, employees and trade unions.</li>
                <li>The EMS would consist of necessary  processes for the organisation to be successful.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4><strong>Leadership</strong> </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Top management must show commitment to  supporting Environmental management system development and implementation. </li>
                <li>Management has a role in ensuring that the  goals for the Environmental management system are clear and consistent with  other organisational goals. </li>
                <li>Management's commitment should be communicated  across the organisation.</li>
                <li>Management should have the necessary authority  and an understanding of the organisation. </li>
                <li>Management should have the time to commit to  the Environmental management system-building process and must have top  management support.</li>
                <li>Contractors, suppliers or other external  parties could be included as part of the project team.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4><strong>Planning</strong></h4>
              <p>  The organisation must ensure the management  system can achieve its intended outcomes and achieve continual improvement. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Organisation  representatives will need to meet regularly, especially in the early stages of  the organisation’s&nbsp;activities  or products or services. </li>
                <li>A  cross-functional team can assist in ensuring that procedures are practical and  useful and can build commitment to the EMS.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4><strong>Risks and opportunities</strong></h4>
              <p><a name="_Hlk19129004">Risks and  opportunities </a>are defined in ISO 14001:2015 as potential  adverse effects (risks/threats) and possible beneficial effects  (opportunities). <br>The EMS requires that documented  information&nbsp;shall be kept of the risks and opportunities and the processes  needed to ensure that the process meets expectations. <br>
                It may well be good practice to generate an official  Risk Register where identification, discussion, actions, outcome, and  monitoring can all be recorded and results evaluated. </p>

              <p><strong>Definition&nbsp;of  Life Cycle:&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>The  definition of the life cycle as per ISO 14001:2015 is   ‘<em>Consecutive and interlinked  stages of a product (or service) system, from the raw material acquisition or  generation from natural resources to final disposal. Life cycle stages include  the acquisition of raw materials, design, production, transportation/delivery,  use, end-of-life treatment, and final disposal</em>.</p>
              <h4><a name="_GoBack"></a><strong>Controlling  outsourced processes</strong> </h4>
              <p>  An organisation  should consider how external providers and outsourced operations can affect its  ability to manage its environmental aspects and fulfil their compliance  obligations. <br>
              An organisation  should establish operational controls that are needed. They could be documented  procedures, contracts or supplier agreements, or end-user instructions, and  communicate them to its contractors, suppliers and users, as appropriate.</p>
              <h4><strong>Reducing emergencies</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
              <p>  Effective planning and  groundwork can decrease injuries, protect employees and neighbours, reduce  asset losses and minimise production downtime. <br>
              An effective emergency  preparation and response program should include requirements for assessing the  potential for accidents and emergencies, preventing incidents and their  associated environmental impacts. </p>
              <h4><strong>Monitoring and Measuring</strong> </h4>
              <p><strong>Monitoring </strong><br>
              can be a process that can checks whether&nbsp;something is happening as  intended or planned. e.g. if an operational control states that housekeeping  audits will occur&nbsp;twice weekly then this is a monitoring process. This  could also apply to ‘visual’ checking of a component. </p>
              <p><strong>Measurement </strong><strong> </strong><br>
              The size or scale of  an event is&nbsp;measured, calculated or estimated with a numerical value  assigned.&nbsp;e.g. weighing wastes sent to landfill; the amount&nbsp;of gas or  electricity consumed per week, measuring noise levels, etc. </p>
              <h4><strong>Continual improvement</strong></h4>
              <p>  Continual improvements mean conducting  internal audits, looking at objectives, performing management reviews, analysing  data, and implementing corrective and&nbsp;preventive actions. <br>
              For example, an  environmental objective can be to reduce electrical energy consumption. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Integrated Management  Systems&nbsp;will have a constructive impact on the outcomes of the ISO  Management Systems.</li>
                <li> will be able to&nbsp;align common components of management system  standards. E.g. policies, objectives, processes and resources. Also, you may be  able to have a single procedure for,&nbsp;document control, management reviews,  training, internal audits or improvements. </li>
                <li>Maintaining the system  will become easy to understand. Therefore, there will be more focus on  achieving objectives that are central to the organisation.</li>
                <li>Organisations will be able  to have a systematic approach to changes. Therefore, decision making will be  more comfortable.</li>
                <li>Organisations will be able  to conduct integrated audits and assessments. Therefore, optimise processes and  resources. And will result in less interruption and thus decrease costs.</li>
                <li>Resources will focus on  process implementation and add value rather than additional system maintenance.</li>
                <li>Will require less  maintenance for continuing compliance checks to ensure that you are maintaining  the management system standards requirements. Therefore, there will be more  focus on improvements rather than maintaining multiple systems.</li>

              <strong>Annex  SL a new high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards in  future.</strong><br><br>
                Annex SL is not an ISO standard. However,  it is a guide to help &nbsp;ISO consultants and organisations to implement  multiple/integrated (MMS/IMS) Management Systems Standards. Over the years, ISO  has published several management system standards for areas of quality,  environment, information security, health and safety and many more.&nbsp; ISO management system&nbsp;standards share  common fundamentals. However, they are not sufficiently aligned, so they were  difficult to integrate at the implementation phase. The most significant  disadvantage was the duplication of work. The guideline of Annex SL will help  you to create a system that entails less maintenance and resources, e.g.  producing one document or process instead of many.<br><br>
                <em>“It is the publication of Annex SL  (formerly ISO Guide 83) which outlines the framework for a generic management  system. All new ISO Management System Standards (MSS) will follow to this  framework, and all current MSS will migrate to the structure at their  succeeding revision. </em><br><br>
                <strong><em>In future, all ISO Management System  Standards (MSS) should be consistent and compatible - they will all have the  same look and feel</em></strong><em>. Annex SL guidelines  could be the commencement of the end of the conflicts, duplication, confusion  and misunderstanding arising from slightly different requirements across the  various ISO Management System Standards.”</em><br><br>
                <strong><em>Reference  IRCA briefing note Annex SL</em></strong><br><br>
                Annex SL (a high-level structure ) is  created to incorporate more than one ISO standard. Several organisations seek  to implement and certify multiple management system standards such as ISO 9001,  ISO 14001, ISO 27001 and ISO 45001. Implementation of more than one standard  has led to the necessity to combine or integrate them effectively and  efficiently. Annex SL (a high-level structure ) helps the organisations to  incorporate these standards. Annex SL defines the outline for a conventional  ISO Management System. <br><br>
                <strong>The Annex SL structure and commonly  used terms and definitions will make it easier to comply with and maintain the  ISO standards requirements with less time and at a lower cost.</strong><br>
                <strong>The most popular standards using Annex  SL are: </strong></p>
