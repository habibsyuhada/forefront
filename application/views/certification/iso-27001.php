      <p>There are various mutual fundamentals between ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 27001. E.g. Document control, management review, document control, corrective action and the requirement for competent personnel. According to Annex SL, a new high-level structure, you can combine these standards into a single joint system.</p>

              An ISO 27001 (ISMS) is a systematic process for managing delicate organisations’ information so that it remains secure. ISO 27001 covers IT systems, processes and people by assessing the risk management process.
              <br>
              <br>
              An ISO 27001 (ISMS) can help small, medium and large businesses in any sector by securing assets critical information. It is also vital for information on the hard drives of computers. ISO 27001 particularly suitable where the protection of data is essential. For example, banking, financial, health, public and IT sectors.
              <br>
              <br>
              ISO 27001 safeguards your organisation and ensure it is adequately protected. There are many ways we use or store information. E.g. print, store electronically, post and email etc.

              <p>Risk management is an essential  characteristic of the Information Security Management System. The ISO 27001  standard explicitly use the approach of assessment towards the security of  assets and information. In the initial evaluation, you acknowledge the risks  and then implement controls to mitigate them.<br><br>
              Accomplishing and sustaining ISO 27001  promises your customers, that, you realise the security of the customer’s  information is vital for your organisation.<br><br>
              Loss of information can lead to considerable  consequences. Implementing ISO 27001 cannot make your organisation resistant  from security breaks. &nbsp;However, it will make them less probable to happen. </p>

              <strong>Annex  SL a new high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards in  future.</strong><br><br>
                Annex SL is not an ISO standard. However,  it is a guide to help &nbsp;ISO consultants and organisations to implement  multiple/integrated (MMS/IMS) Management Systems Standards. Over the years, ISO  has published several management system standards for areas of quality,  environment, information security, health and safety and many more.&nbsp; ISO management system&nbsp;standards share  common fundamentals. However, they are not sufficiently aligned, so they were  difficult to integrate at the implementation phase. The most significant  disadvantage was the duplication of work. The guideline of Annex SL will help  you to create a system that entails less maintenance and resources, e.g.  producing one document or process instead of many.<br><br>
                <em>“It is the publication of Annex SL  (formerly ISO Guide 83) which outlines the framework for a generic management  system. All new ISO Management System Standards (MSS) will follow to this  framework, and all current MSS will migrate to the structure at their  succeeding revision. </em><br><br>
                <strong><em>In future, all ISO Management System  Standards (MSS) should be consistent and compatible - they will all have the  same look and feel</em></strong><em>. Annex SL guidelines  could be the commencement of the end of the conflicts, duplication, confusion  and misunderstanding arising from slightly different requirements across the  various ISO Management System Standards.”</em><br><br>
                <strong><em>Reference  IRCA briefing note Annex SL</em></strong><br><br>
                Annex SL (a high-level structure ) is  created to incorporate more than one ISO standard. Several organisations seek  to implement and certify multiple management system standards such as ISO 9001,  ISO 14001, ISO 27001 and ISO 45001. Implementation of more than one standard  has led to the necessity to combine or integrate them effectively and  efficiently. Annex SL (a high-level structure ) helps the organisations to  incorporate these standards. Annex SL defines the outline for a conventional  ISO Management System. <br><br>
                <strong>The Annex SL structure and commonly  used terms and definitions will make it easier to comply with and maintain the  ISO standards requirements with less time and at a lower cost.</strong><br>
                <strong>The most popular standards using Annex  SL are: </strong></p>

              <p>Cybercrime is a criminal act committed  using computers and the internet. <br><br>
              All organisations hold accountability  for the risk of theft, fraud, and should address risks by putting in place  proportional controls to mitigate the risks.<br><br>
              <strong>Email hacking: </strong>Email hackers attempt to gain access to email accounts by  tricking people into the opening and responding to spam emails, phishing  emails, emails with harmful content, also known as a virus.<br><br>
              <strong>Phishing: </strong>Phishing messages look trustworthy with a similar format  to official emails and also use corporate logos. Phishing emails request for  verification of account numbers, personal information, passwords and date of  birth. The people who respond to may suffer financial losses.<br><br>
              <strong>Malvertising: </strong>Sometimes, cybercriminals use advertisements or click on  what looks like an advert as a means to hack into computers. &nbsp;<br><br>
              To mitigate the risk of above as a  minimum, we should do:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Strong       passwords for all your devices and accounts.</li>
                <li>Use the       wrong mother’s maiden name</li>
                <li>Use       firewalls</li>
                <li>Antivirus software       and process for systematic scanning for malware.</li>
                <li>Check if the       email address is genuine before, for example, sending payment, data or       passwords.</li>
                <li>Contact directly       with the sender, for instance, change of bank details or requests payment. </li>
                <li>Communicate       the risks of using public Wi-Fi.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4><strong>ISO 27001 strategies for organisations</strong></h4>
              <p>  As part of its assessment evaluation  organisations should consider some following examples:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Organisations should  have a clear understanding of cyber threats and their vulnerabilities. Also, the  information it holds and which are critical to the business operations.</li>
                <li>Protect their IT  devices, including hardware, software and data, from accidental or unauthorised  access.</li>
                <li>The organisation should  proactively manage cyber risks as an integrated part of comprehensive risk  management by inspecting security policies, technical activities.</li>
                <li>The organisations  should govern processes in place to safeguard and mitigate threats.</li>
                <li>Training and processes,  for staff to protect devices and data outside formal work settings, including  in transit.</li>
                <li>Security policies for  safe use of removable media such as CDs, flash/pen drives, and mobile phones. And  logs review for strange behaviour.&nbsp; </li>
                <li>Train staff about cyber  risks. For example, the threat from public Wi-Fi, dangers from the use of  removable media such as USB sticks, maintain backups and keep away from using  personal accounts for business purposes and reporting of incidents and issues.</li>
