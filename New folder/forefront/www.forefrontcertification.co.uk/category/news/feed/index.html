								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>There are many Certification Bodies on the market to audit your organisation and choosing the right one is a vital decision to ensure peace of mind and credibility.</h3>
<p>Unlike many industries, there is no mandatory regulatory body for certification bodies, meaning there is no protection or recompense for those who make the wrong choice. Checking that you are working with a UKAS Certification Body will ensure that your hard-earned resources are not wasted on certification that may not be recognized by your customers.</p>
<p>In 2010 the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) was appointed the UK government as the sole National accreditation body in accordance with EU legislation to assess against internationally agreed standards.</p>
<p>UKAS accreditation involves a lengthy and rigorous analysis of policies and procedures and if successful, provides an assurance that the highest standards of service delivery are met and consistently maintained.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the benefits?  </strong></h3>
<p>Selecting a UKAS accredited Certication Body such as ForeFront Certication takes the risk out of your service procurement. It also offers confidence that due diligence, evidence of best practice and an internationally recognized standard(s) such as ISO 9001:2015 and ISO14001:2015 have been met.</p>
<p>Want to know more about how we can help you get certification that will add value and provide a mark of confidence?</p>
<p><strong>Then simply call us on 0121 726 2999 or email <a href="mailto:info@forefrontcertification.co.uk">info@forefrontcertification.co.uk</a>                                                                                                                            </strong></p>

<p>To achieve long-term success and feasibility of an organization. Is it really true???</p>
<p>Is this the main reason to achieve this, something I would like to know?</p>
<p>International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2017 survey says that over 1 million organizations across 189 countries hold ISO 9001 Certification.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>8.2 Emergency preparedness and response</strong></p>
<p>Another great CQI event on ISO45001 last Friday. No surprises, that <strong>Leadership</strong> is key, and we must be ensuring competent people are in the right roles to establish, implement and maintain the processes for emergency situations.</p>
<p>All organisations, regardless of size or activity must address the <strong>hazard identification</strong> and <strong>risks</strong> to respond to potential emergency situations. How often are we trying to adapt to meet the needs of our customers? – extending our shift patterns &#8211; adding extra shifts to accommodate our customer needs and meeting the demands of our interested parties. One of the scenario’s that was highlighted was an 8.00am start of shift -major accident, during a catalogue of events it came to light no First Aid cover was available.  The accident involved caused quite a nasty injury, the business has Certification to all three core Standards, but lack of emergency preparedness and response review became quite apparent.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention / hazard identification</strong> is<strong> critical</strong> to tackling worker safety, we need to manage all our risks to ensure process efficiency.  Apart from the devastating personal impact, this then leads to loss of key worker, business interruption on meeting your orders on time, claims, reputational damage and so on.</p>
<p>Organisations must ensure that emergency plans are <strong><u>reviewed</u></strong><u> </u>and ready to be deployed so the everyone involved can respond effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying events</strong></p>
<p>The obvious starting point for emergency planning is the identification of what emergencies there might be. Most organisations identify fire as a possible emergency and consider first aid requirements for accidents and ill health, but as you can understand it goes well beyond that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire</li>
<li>Injury / Illness</li>
<li>Spills and leaks</li>
<li>Rescue from confined space</li>
<li>Utility Failure</li>
<li>Adverse weather – snow, wind, flooding</li>
<li>Bomb Threat</li>
<li>Security Incident</li>
<li>Violence and Aggression</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also many other things that can create emergencies including flooding, terrorism, vandalism, theft and food poisoning caused by an organisation’s canteen etc.</p>
<p>Your organisation needs to identify potential emergency situations, assess OH&amp;S risks associated with these emergency situations and maintain a process to prevent or minimise OH&amp;S risks from potential emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>Practice response in desktop exercises</li>
<li>Provide simple instructions to all emergency team members</li>
<li>Establish good communications for emergency team, e.g. radios</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think detail – who will guide emergency services to the incident?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What information needs to be available to emergency services, what cover is needed on shifts? who will deputise for key roles?</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just because you made workplace safety efforts last year, do not assume that you no longer need to continually update your current system of safety training programs and processes.</p>
<p>We cannot become complacent when it comes to getting every worker home safe. Continued safety training and efforts to make workplace hazard free is critical to the health and wellbeing of your workers, not to mention the financial stability of your organisation.</p>
